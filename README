Brief Presentation of the methods and results in English.
Deeper description in Italian.

Resolution of an Activity Recognition problem using different techniques:
- KNN
- SVM
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- QDA
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

- FeedForward NEURAL NETWORK

The dataset: http://cs.unibo.it/projects/us-tm2017/

Was used the classical pipeline:
Data Acqusition-> Data Preprocessing-> Data Modeling-> Data Evalutation.

In the Preprocessing step was carried out also a dimensionality reduction using PCA to explore the comparison between results on the whole dataset and the reduced one.
